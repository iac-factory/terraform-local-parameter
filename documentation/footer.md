- [**Versioning**](https://semver.org) is not an arbitrarily made up concept ([The 12-Factor Application](https://12factor.net/build-release-run)).
- For better or for worse, it's never okay to affect others without communication.
- *[Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/4/html/introduction_to_system_administration/s1-philosophy-document)* is no different than code.
